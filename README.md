# Wine_quality
This is self learning project on classification and regression models for a wine quality dataset.

Dataset source:
P. Cortez, A. Cerdeira, F. Almeida, T. Matos and J. Reis.
Modeling wine preferences by data mining from physicochemical properties. In Decision Support Systems, Elsevier, 47(4):547-553, 2009.

I have used red wine dataset for classification and white wine dataset for regression.
Models i have used:
Classification:
1. decision tree
2. knn
3. logistic regression
4. svm

Regression
1. linear regression
2. logistic regression
3. lasso regression
4. ridge regression
5. svm regression

In both cases, SVM model performed well.
I have also tried feature selection strategies to remove less influential features to improve performance.
